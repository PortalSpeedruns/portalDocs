### Beginner - Dacciox's Blind SG

%y https://youtu.be/8Lda5YeLGMI

First version of the blind [Save Glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch). Potentially slightly faster.

### Advanced - Turretless SG

## Inbounds No SLA

### Beginner - Double Edge Glitch

%y https://youtu.be/dra4RTn-F2k

Two [Edge Glitches](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-edge-glitch) that get you past the door halfway through the chamber.

### Advanced - End Platform Reportals

%y https://youtu.be/Dd18VMnZT08

Somewhat precise reportals to skip some of the end platforms. Saves a few seconds each time.

## Out of Bounds

See the section on [Under Elevator](./chamber13#out-of-bounds).

## Glitchless

### Beginner - Camera Door Wedge

%y https://youtu.be/3Y0bPhvjpCI

Another camera trick. Maintaining the orientation of the camera after shooting it off the wall is extremely important.<br>
**Please Note:** [Portal funneling](./introduction#keybinds-portal-funneling) ON makes the last room much easier.

### Advanced - Reportals

%y https://youtu.be/Dd18VMnZT08

Difficult Reportals that save a small amount of time. Video is from an Inbounds tutorial, but the basic strategy is the same.

### Advanced - Overheads

%y https://youtu.be/UJbW52KapL4

Very difficult strafes that can save about 1-2 seconds.
