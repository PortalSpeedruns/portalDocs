Basic movement with a portal shot under the door.

### Intermediate - Save Delay

%y https://youtu.be/orGlVBUCvgY

Saves 1-2 seconds over the standard method if done perfect, but the saveload timing can take a bit to get used to.

### Advanced - 10 In Front (Early Elevator Activation)

%y https://youtu.be/c6K3wP8sKp4

Saves around 3 seconds by using the Save Delay method to hit the triggers for the elevator in a different order, making it start going up earlier and keeping the doors open for the start of 10.

### Intermediate - SG Preserve + In Front

%y https://youtu.be/SDIt-VnORNw

Preserving the [Save Glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) from 09 into 10 so you can skip getting [Save Glitched](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) again, as well as starting 10 in front of the elevator.

### Advanced - Early Activation + SG Preserve

%y https://youtu.be/ttGE8s9T3xo

Saves one second over the intermediate strat by implementing early activation. Requires good movement and has some tight timings.
There is also an alternate way to do the ending [here](https://www.youtu.be/jvYXdnRwues)
