Saves 1-2 seconds over the standard method if done perfect, but the saveload timing can take a bit to get used to.

### Advanced - 10 In Front (Early Elevator Activation)

Saves around 3 seconds by using the Save Delay method to hit the triggers for the elevator in a different order, making it start going up earlier and keeping the doors open for the start of 10.

Preserving the [Save Glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) from 09 into 10 so you can skip getting [Save Glitched](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) again, as well as starting 10 in front of the elevator.

Saves one second over the intermediate strat by implementing early activation. Requires good movement and has some tight timings.
There is also an alternate way to do the ending [here](https://www.youtu.be/jvYXdnRwues)
