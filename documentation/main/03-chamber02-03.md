### Beginner - New Game

%y https://youtu.be/QTb8TxCiHqE

Simple [Save Glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) to get under the elevator that uses the new game feature to get up to 04. You must record video to use this since it requires pausing and you also have to use `sv_unlockedchapters 0` every time you reset.<br>
You can accomplish that by adding it to the end of your restart command. (`bind <key> "speedrun_start; sv_unlockedchapters 0"`)
