## Inbounds (+ NoSLA)
### Beginner - Portal Peek

The easiest route. If the portal peek is too difficult, you can also [jump to the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmyyRNIbiB0).

### Advanced - ABH Over Goo

A difficult but very fast strat. There are also alternative setups:
- [Adamantite's Over Goo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dtT9HZmVdo)
- [Circlestrafe Over Goo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEjFAkwkwKs)

## Out of Bounds
### Advanced - OoB Over Goo
If you did [06 in front of elevator](./chamber06-07#out-of-bounds-advanced-in-front-of-elevator) and you want to do Over Goo, you'll need to use a different setup for it, as seen in the [06 In Front Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9Smd_IAJg4&t=495s).

## Glitchless
### Beginner - Portal Peek
The Glitchless strat is the same as [the basic Inbounds one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7re62Wj554) just with [bunnyhopping](./movement-and-glitches#basic-movement-bunny-hopping) as movement instead of [ABH's](/movement-and-glitches#basic-movement-abh).

If the portal peek is too difficult, you can also [jump to the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmyyRNIbiB0).
