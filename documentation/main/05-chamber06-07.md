## Inbounds (+ No SLA)

### General Tutorial

This shows the basic routes for the level as well as some optimizations.

### Advanced - Camera Launch

You can preserve a camera from 05 and use it to launch yourself to the end of the level in 06.<br>
This saves about a second.<br>
**For Inbounds:** It's recommended to do [06 in front](./chamber04-05#inbounds-advanced-06-in-front) instead of the camera launch as it's way more consistent.

## Out of Bounds

### Beginner - Seamshot

Very precise but simple shot set up in the previous map.
<br>
[cl_showpos](./introduction#keybinds-cl-showpos) coordinates: `-66.80 168.77`

### Advanced - In Front of Elevator

%y https://youtu.be/Z9Smd_IAJg4

A modified seamshot, followed by a very hard chain of actions to get you in front of the elevator in 08.
<br>
[cl_showpos](./introduction#keybinds-cl-showpos) coordinates are `-66.80 168.77`

### Advanced - Build 3420

In this version of the game, regular seamshot is possible but in front of elevator is not due to the lack of quantum crouching.
