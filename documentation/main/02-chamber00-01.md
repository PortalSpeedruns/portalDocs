This is a very timing intensive strat that can reward you with 14 seconds of timesave at the start of a run.

Strategy that uses the radio to get out of the vault well before the portal opens. This strategy should be paired with a [BSG](./chamber00-01#inbounds-intermediate-button-save-glitch) in Chamber 01 and uses a save load timing that is similar to [BSG](./chamber00-01#inbounds-intermediate-button-save-glitch). This saves a significant amount of time, over 50 seconds if done well.

**Unrestricted Only:** Strategy that uses the radio to get out of the vault well before the portal opens. This strategy is similar to the [Inbounds Vault Skip](./chamber00-01#inbounds-intermediate-vault-skip) however it is done without the save loads like [here](https://youtu.be/I21I2mlWH8A) and is VERY inconsistent. <u>Only recommended when going for top times</u>. This can save a significant amount of time, over 50 seconds if done well.

Strategy that uses the radio to get out of the vault well before the portal opens. This strategy should be paired with a [BSG](./chamber00-01#inbounds-intermediate-button-save-glitch) in Chamber 01 and uses a save load timing that is similar to [BSG](./chamber00-01#inbounds-intermediate-button-save-glitch). This strategy can save ~25 seconds over [Rubby Save Glitch](./chamber00-01#out-of-bounds-advanced-rubby-save-glitch) on version 5135 and is 1-2 seconds faster than performing [02 Skip](./chamber00-01#out-of-bounds-expert-02-skip) on version 3420.

### Advanced - Rubby Save Glitch

A way to lose collision after the first portal opens, letting you fly right to the elevator at the end. [(alternate launch setup)](https://youtu.be/q6D-HgOO4Zc)

### Advanced - Omelette Skip

%y https://youtu.be/OnO-U6qYovM

**Build 3420 Only**<br>
The fastest route when paired with [Vault Skip](./chamber00-01#out-of-bounds-intermediate-vault-skip). Uses the cube to get [Save Glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) to skip the 02 dialogue. Refer to the [old 02 Skip video](https://youtu.be/q6D-HgOO4Zc) for getting on top of the elevator and getting into the room.

### Expert - 02 Skip

%y https://youtu.be/q6D-HgOO4Zc

**Build 3420 Only**<br>
This is the most reset heavy trick in the run and recommended to not do until at least sub 8:00. To get the launch more consistently: Jump after the radio touches the wall, and before Chell touches the radio.
