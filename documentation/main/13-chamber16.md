## Inbounds

### Beginner - Save Glitch

There is also a [3 shot method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CvD4VrJug) but it is difficult to do fast and you cannot land in the ending hallway.

### Advanced - Turret Preserve

This is a difficult route that preserves a turret and your [Save Glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) into chamber 17, allowing you to skip most of the chamber. It is recommended to do the faster [Turretless SG Preserve](./chamber16#inbounds-advanced-turretless-sg-preserve)

### Advanced - Turretless SG Preserve

A more difficult [Save Glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) preserve that goes all the way to chamber 18. This saves around 8-10 seconds over regular [Turret Preserve](./chamber16#inbounds-advanced-turret-preserve)<br>
If you want to save another second or you find it easier, you can also do [Preserve + In Front](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1eO5mmhyAQ).

## Inbounds No SLA

This strat uses two portal bumps to get to the end of the chamber.

A slow but easy route in case you are not comfortable with the harder strats yet.

### Intermediate - Spiderman Strats

Currently the most optimal route. There are slight optimizations that will be covered in a later video.

### Intermediate - Portal Peeks

The previously most optimal route before [Spiderman](./chamber16#glitchless-intermediate-spiderman-strats) was created.
