Very difficult and unreliable strat that skips the last double fling, which saves about 7 seconds if done perfectly.

## Out of Bounds

### Beginner - Under Elevator

[Save Glitching](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) and going out of bounds to get under the elevator for 11.

### Intermediate - Alternate VWW

Using a [Vertical Wall Warp](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-vertical-wall-warp) to get to the top of the chamber. This route is slower than the one in the advanced section below but does not require a series of [ABHs](./movement-and-glitches#basic-movement-abh) you may find difficult.

### Advanced - VWW

Using a [Vertical Wall Warp](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-vertical-wall-warp) to get to the top of the chamber.

### Build 3420

You will need to pause during the level transition to stop your velocity during the [VWW](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-vertical-wall-warp) route.

## Glitchless

### Beginner - Flings

Having [portal funneling](./introduction#keybinds-portal-funneling) on helps with the last fling.

### Intermediate - Portal Stand

Tricky, skips the first fling though so it's definitely worthwhile.
