## Inbounds

### Beginner - Legacy

%y https://youtu.be/wfdPf6eh7v4

Route for new runners, but is much slower than the [save glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) routes listed below.

### Intermediate - Szeimartin's SG "Route 4"

%y https://youtu.be/aib6hO7MJos

Requires some precise shots, but not too hard once you get used to it. [Alternate Setup](https://youtu.be/Oyihh0rjBnA)

### Intermediate - Static SG

%y https://youtu.be/9ETqPbTVwXc

If you are having trouble with the Route 4 Save Glitch, you can try this one instead. Shots are a little more precise to line up. The fastest route if done perfectly.

## Inbounds No SLA

### Beginner - Legacy

Route for new runners.

### Intermediate - Flippy Skippy Skip

%y https://youtu.be/Frjz4nKnwuc

Difficult optimization for the legacy route. Also the best named strat of all time.

### Advanced - Angle Glitch Save Glitch

%y https://youtu.be/3FWEHlHGg0w

**Unrestricted Only:** Uses a modified version of [save glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) called Angle Glitch Save Glitch or AGSG which doesn't require loading to do a series of precise shots to get to the end of the level.

## Out of Bounds

### Beginner - General

%y https://youtu.be/KEowVV7jflI

Basic portal shooting to get to the next load zone. **Build 3420:** Slightly different due to free oob movement.

## Glitchless

### Beginner - Basic Route

%y https://youtu.be/mLElIeb6JnQ

Basic route using the flippy skippy trick (aka TFSTFWST).

### Advanced - Flippy Skippy Skip (with Turret)

%y https://youtu.be/TXauQifcDJQ

Very challenging but fast optimization for the flippy skippy trick. Saves a lot of time and provides the portal for the turret glass break.
