## Inbounds (+ No SLA)

### Beginner - Flings + GLaDOS with Incinerator

%y https://youtu.be/fubeSk_UlpU

Simple flings from start to finish, nothing too difficult. Skips the GLaDOS dialogue using a turret. Uses the incinerator to destroy the cores, just like in a normal playthrough.

### Beginner - GLaDOS with Corefall Skip

%y https://youtu.be/wzP9rcM4rbs

Uses an [edge glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-edge-glitch) to incinerate the cores without them having to fall out of your portal into the shaft.

### Intermediate - Catwalk Skip

%y https://youtu.be/rEsFwwdaDKc

Skips the long flings and the [ABH](./movement-and-glitches#basic-movement-abh) on the bridge to get to the door as fast as possible.

### Intermediate - Single AAG

%y https://youtu.be/vHT_lqLnlEk

Uses an [Acute Angle Glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-lag-aag-vag) to get you and the turret directly to the GLaDOS room. Saves roughly 8 seconds over Catwalk Skip.

### Advanced - Double AAG

%y https://youtu.be/y6IrwBHt9no

Uses a second more precisely timed [AAG](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-lag-aag-vag) to get to the ledge. Potentially about a second faster than Single [AAG](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-lag-aag-vag).

## Out of Bounds

### Beginner - PQR

%y https://youtu.be/f5TjjRjgefk

A series of portal shots and PQRs to get to GLaDOS' chamber.

### Beginner - Corefall Skip

%y https://youtu.be/wzP9rcM4rbs

Uses an [edge glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-edge-glitch) to incinerate the cores without them having to fall out of your portal into the shaft.

### Intermediate - AAG

%y https://youtu.be/lYkfF4rMvYc

Similar route to inbounds but starting OoB and replaces the first [AAG](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-lag-aag-vag) with a PQR.

### Advanced - Save Glitch

%y https://youtu.be/CS7rcK_F6xU

A somewhat precise [save glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) that has the potential of saving 2-3 seconds over the [AAG](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-lag-aag-vag) route. [VWW](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-vertical-wall-warp) can be tricky because of the long loading times in e02. In 3420 you can do the crouch into the level transition, while in 5135 you will need to portal yourself over to the same area.

## Glitchless

### Beginner - Basic Route

%y https://youtu.be/f7oqD5BGhBs

The GLaDOS fight will take a little practice. Standing in the correct spot before the rocket turret comes out is <u>very</u> important.

### Intermediate - Catwalk Skip + Fast GLaDOS

%y https://youtu.be/zy1dACjHHHQ

Skips the long flings and catwalk to get to GLaDOS as fast as possible, plus a faster version of the GLaDOS fight.

### Advanced - Advanced Optimizations

%y https://youtu.be/tgPJ-WQUr5U

Multiple optmizations throughout e02 that each save a small amount of time, but are very necessary at a high level.
