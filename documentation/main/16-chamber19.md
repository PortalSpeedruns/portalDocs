## Inbounds

### Beginner - Short LAG

%y https://youtu.be/Rsz9z4DawYQ

A pretty easy [LAG] that gets you to the room above the fire pit. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MQdHqlgprE) is an alternative to the [Edge Glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-edge-glitch) if you are having trouble with it.

### Beginner - Peeks

%y https://youtu.be/wFNPWdvNlgM

Uses Portal Peeking to get to the end, **not recommended**.

### Intermediate - Loch Ness Monster

%y https://youtu.be/MjwnD5K2lkQ

A faster [LAG] route that warps you into some goo you have to swim out of (hence the name). A replacement for the single [LAG] that leads nicely into Double [LAG].

### Intermediate - Save Glitch

%y https://youtu.be/lTrjLb0xEgw

[Save Glitch] after [Loch Ness] that saves a lot of time over the beginner ending, and has potential to be around 1 second faster than Double [LAG].

### Advanced - Double LAG

%y https://youtu.be/MjwnD5K2lkQ?start=200

**Important clarification starts at 7:33 in the video.**

A second, difficult, additional LAG after the first one that gets you to the very end of the map. Very difficult to understand and perform consistently.

### Advanced - No SLA Double LAG

%y https://youtu.be/CgPd65CZAR4

Uses [Edge Glitches](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-edge-glitch) and Portal Peeks to set up a second LAG. Use [the other double lag video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjwnD5K2lkQ&t=272s) as well to understand how the second [LAG] works.

## Out of Bounds

### Intermediate - 19 In Front
