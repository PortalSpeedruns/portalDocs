## Inbounds

### Beginner - Legacy

See in the [No SLA section].

### Intermediate - Vertical Angle Glitch

See in the [No SLA section].

### Advanced - Turret Preserve

See the section on [Turret Preserve].<br>
You can also use [Save Delay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqnpvtxUcIg&t=151s) to make the jump through the glass easier.

### Advanced - Turretless SG preserve

See the section on [Turretless].<br>
There is also an alternative way [to end the chamber](https://youtu.be/VoHnlvQOlbY).

## Inbounds No SLA

### Beginner - Legacy

%y https://youtu.be/plfNytkCs-w

This strat uses the Companion Cube to get past the orbs, followed by Portal Bumps to get to the final room.

### Intermediate - Vertical Angle Glitch

%y https://youtu.be/jZobqM3Wac0

**This strat is not allowed in NoSLA _Legacy_**
<br><br>
Uses precise angles to perform a [VAG] and warp you straight to the elevator. (For the QCE, start your uncrouch right before you shoot.)

## Out of Bounds

See the section on [Under Elevator].

## Glitchless

### Beginner - Camera Stack

%y https://youtu.be/kzku2hO9Fog

An easier but slower version of the camera stack seen below.

### Intermediate - Camera Stack

%y https://youtu.be/4LVfo3lV38I

Uses a cube stacked on top of a camera to skip the main puzzle.

### Intermediate - Fling

%y https://youtu.be/PzgOzpOgJ54

This strat uses precise portals to fling to the end of the chamber. It's a few seconds faster than camera stack, but does require some quick aiming.<br>
The angle for the floor portal is roughly between `-108.25` and `-109.50`.
