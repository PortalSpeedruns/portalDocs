## Inbounds

### Beginner - Legacy

If you don't want to do the [Save Glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) for this chamber, you can do the [No SLA strat](./chamber13#inbounds-no-sla-beginner-legacy) instead.

A somewhat precise [Save Glitch](./movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch) that saves a couple of seconds over the No SLA strat, if done correctly.

This video explains chamber 13-18 since they are all very fast and similar.

This strat is **much** more difficult than UE1 and only recommended when going for top times.

The overall time save compared to UE1 is about 2-3 seconds.
