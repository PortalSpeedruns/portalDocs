This is a very timing intensive strat that can reward you with 14 seconds of timesave at the start of a run.

### Intermediate - Vault Skip

Strategy that uses the radio to get out of the vault well before the portal opens. This strategy should be paired with a [BSG](#inbounds-bsg) in Chamber 01 and uses a save load timing that is similar to [BSG](#inbounds-bsg). This saves a significant amount of time, over 50 seconds if done well.

**Unrestricted Only:** Strategy that uses the radio to get out of the vault well before the portal opens. This strategy is similar to the [Inbounds Vault Skip](#inbounds-vault-skip) however it is done without the save loads like [here](https://youtu.be/I21I2mlWH8A) and is VERY inconsistent. <u>Only recommended when going for top times</u>. This can save a significant amount of time, over 50 seconds if done well. 

## Out of Bounds

Strategy that uses the radio to get out of the vault well before the portal opens. This strategy should be paired with a [BSG](#inbounds-bsg) in Chamber 01 and uses a save load timing that is similar to [BSG](#inbounds-bsg). This strategy can save ~25 seconds over [Rubby Save Glitch](#out-of-bounds-rubby-Save Glitch) on version 5135 and is 1-2 seconds faster than performing [02 Skip](#out-of-bounds-02-skip) on version 3420.

### Advanced - Rubby Save Glitch

A way to lose collision after the first portal opens, letting you fly right to the elevator at the end. [(alternate launch setup)](https://youtu.be/q6D-HgOO4Zc)
### Advanced - Omelette Skip

**Build 3420 Only**<br>
The fastest route when paired with [Vault Skip](#out-of-bounds-vault-skip). Uses the cube to get save glitch to skip the 02 dialogue. Refer to the [old 02 skip video](https://youtu.be/q6D-HgOO4Zc) for getting on top of the elevator and getting into the room.

### Expert - 02 Skip

**Build 3420 Only**<br>
This is the most reset heavy trick in the run and recommended to not do until at least sub 8:00. To get the launch more consistently: Jump after the radio touches the wall, and before Chell touches the radio.
