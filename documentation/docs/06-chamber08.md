The easiest route. If the portal peek is too difficult, you can also [jump to the plattform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmyyRNIbiB0).

### ABH Over Goo (Advanced)

A difficult but very fast strat. There are also alternative setups:
- [Crisper's Over Goo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ8eI-wdW5E)
- [Adamantite's Over Goo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dtT9HZmVdo)
- [Circlestrafe Over Goo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEjFAkwkwKs)

## Out of Bounds
### OOB Over Goo (Advanced)
If you did [06 in front of elevator](./chamber-06-07#out-of-bounds-in-front-of-elevator-adv) you'll need to use a different setup for Over Goo as seen in the [06 In Front Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9Smd_IAJg4&t=495s).

## Glitchless
### Portal Peek (Beginner)
The Glitchless strat is the same as [the basic Inbounds one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7re62Wj554) just with bunnyhopping as movement instead of ABH's.
