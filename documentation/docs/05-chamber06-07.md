This shows the basic routes for the chamber as well as some optimizations.

### Advanced - Camera Launch

You can preserve a camera from 05 and use it to launch yourself to the end of the chamber in 06.
<br>
This saves about a second.
<br>**For Inbounds:** It's recommended to do [06 in front](./chamber04-05#inbounds-advanced-06-in-front) instead of the camera launch as it's way more consistent.

## Out of Bounds
### Beginner - Seamshot

Very precise but simple shot set up in the previous chamber.

### Advanced - In Front of Elevator

A modified seamshot, followed by a very hard chain of actions to get you in front of the elevator in 08.

### Advanced - Build 3420 
In this version of the game, regular seamshot is possible but in front of elevator is not due to the lack of quantum crouching.
