The mouse wheel allows you to spam jump inputs much faster than pressing a key, this enables you to spend as little time on the floor as possible.\n\nTo initiate an ABH, you need a certain starting velocity. You can achieve this by jumping forwards and turning 180 degrees mid-air. You may also start an ABH by jumping backwards and releasing S after you jump.\nAt the same time you want to start holding your crouch key and let go of W. When you're about to land, start scrolling your mouse wheel. You want to keep scrolling in small controlled bursts every time you get close to the ground.\nDon't scroll too fast, or the game will ignore your inputs. Do not hold S or the ABH will not work.\n\nIf done correctly, this will build your speed up with every hop you perform.\nThis is because of how Valve tried to patch out bunnyhopping from the engine. Whenever the game detects that you're going above the speed limit (300 hu/s), it will push you in the opposite direction of where you're facing.\nThis is why you need to be facing backwards for an ABH to work. (There are workarounds for this, which are explained in the AFH section).\n\nAdding air strafes using the A and D key and moving your mouse in the opposite direction mid-air will increase your acceleration."},{"breadcrumbs":["Movement & Glitches","Basic Movement","AFH"],"href":"/main/movement-and-glitches#basic-movement-afh","content":"Accelerated Forwards Hopping or AFH requires an even higher starting velocity to work.\nTo AFH, you need to be facing the direction you want to go. Hold the S key in midair and start scrolling every time you are about to hit the ground.\nThe game now thinks you are going backwards, and using the same logic as before, will try to slow you down by applying forwards velocity. This requires a higher initial velocity, since otherwise it will just slow you down like intended.\nAFHing is used in Chamber 07 and Chamber 10, and also in some more advanced strats, like the starting AFH in Chamber 11.\nWhile those chambers give you enough initial velocity to AFH right away, if you want to do it without the starting velocity, you need to either use an &quot;S tap&quot; (which is just pressing and holding S the moment you hit the ground) or use a +strafe key."},{"breadcrumbs":["Movement & Glitches","Basic Movement","ASH"],"href":"/main/movement-and-glitches#basic-movement-ash","content":"Accelerated Sideways Hopping or ASH, is more commonly used in the Half-Life 2 speedrun.\nYou can see where you're going, with an ASH and you don't need a high velocity to start one off, however it can be hard to control. You can use it in certain places to cover short walking distances quickly, and it can be used to pre-aim for the next portal shot by more advanced players.\nThis is considered more of an optimization than a required strat.\n\nTo perform an ASH, start a forwards jump similar to the start to an ABH, but instead of turning 180 degrees, turn about 45 degrees to the left or right.\nIf you turned 45 degrees left, you want to hold down both S and D, as you continue jumping whenever you hit the ground.

Looking up would cause the &quot;True Position&quot; to actually face towards the wall on the right instead.\nHowever since the blue portal and the target shot are separated by a wall, which adds a certain distance, you will have to move a tiny bit forwards away from the orange portal without exiting the &quot;bubble&quot; that counts as being Edge Glitched.\nThis now places the &quot;True Position&quot; directly above the door, allowing you to place a portal in front of it and continuing the route using the same system again.\nThe blue portal will now be on the floor, once again at a different angle than orange and the previous blue. This will change the way the &quot;True Position&quot; faces again.\n\nTo get the next shot you notice how the player has to look up onto the ceiling:\n\n\nMeanwhile the &quot;True Position&quot; looks similar to this:\n\n\nYour &quot;True Position&quot; and the view you see will do the same movements according to how either sides portal is facing, everything is exactly mirrored."},{"breadcrumbs":["Movement & Glitches","Glitches","Save Glitch"],"href":"/main/movement-and-glitches#glitches-save-glitch","content":"Save Glitch or SG starts off the same as the Edge Glitch, while standing on top or next to the edge of a portal your camera gets dislocated from your body, the difference is that if you now save and then load that save you will be stuck in this state even if you move away from the portal.\n\nCollision while in the Save Glitch state is determined by what we call &quot;Portal Physics Bubbles.&quot; These bubbles exist to provide very basic physics calculations while a player is passing through a portal, before it is quickly updated to use the normal physics. The two key differences with these physics bubbles compared to normal physics are:\n\nCollision with the floor, walls and ceiling is only rendered in a small area around the portal you have Save Glitched on (hence the term &quot;bubble&quot;)\nOnly Props positioned in FRONT of the Save Glitched portal have collision\n\nThis means that props such as doors can be walked through like they don't exist if positioned behind the Save Glitched portal\n\nSave Glitches get cancelled by passing through a portal or getting too close to one.\nOverall every action you perform is exactly mirrored for the &quot;True Position&quot; just like with a normal Edge Glitch."},{"breadcrumbs":["Movement & Glitches","Glitches","LAG/AAG/VAG"],"href":"/main/movement-and-glitches#glitches-lag-aag-vag","content":"LAG, AAG and VAG (Large, Acute and Vertical angle glitches) are all variations of the same exploit, abusing a bug in the way teleports are executed. All of these give the same effect: the player is teleported three times in a single tick, once from the entry portal to the exit portal, and twice from the exit portal to the entry portal. The first two teleports cancel each other out, but the third places the player the same distance away from the entry portal as to the exit portal, but in a different direction.\n\nNow, despite all versions of this glitch having the same end result, each version has different activation methods and requirements.\n\nLAG/AAG:\nTo trigger these angle glitches, you must enter a portal that is facing down and come out of a portal facing up. In addition, you must enter the portal standing and one of the two portals must not be facing exactly up or down. There are some more specific requirements on which angles of portals this trick will work for, but that's the general idea.\n\nVAG:\nThe activation of this is different from LAG/AAG, it requires the player to stand exactly on a portal boundary (usually precise to 6-8 total decimal places). This trick should be possible on any orientations of portals, including wall, floor, and angled portals. However, this is not guaranteed to work for any particular pair of portals, in fact the majority of the time it will not. Due to the nature of the exploit, it is effectively impossible to predict when it will work on a specific portal pair, and it is extremely sensitive to many conditions including but not limited to: the orientation and locations of both portals, the portal placement order, and where the portals were shot from. Unlike LAG/AAG, VAG is also possible to perform on props.\n\nSave Glitch from angle glitches\nAfter some angle glitches, the player will get a modified form of Save Glitch. This modified Save Glitch has different prop interactions than regular Save Glitch and can be cancelled simply by shooting the Save Glitch portal.
